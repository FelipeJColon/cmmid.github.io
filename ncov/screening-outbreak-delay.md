**Aim:** To determine if interventions aimed at air travellers can delay establishment of a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in a previously unaffected country with no shared border with China.

**Results summary:** We evaluated sensitisation effectiveness of 30, 50 and 70%, assuming either 1, 10, or 100 infected travellers per week. We found that early in the outbreak when only few infected travellers arrive, traveller sensitisation can delay a major outbreak in a previously unaffected region. For 50% effectiveness, and assuming 1 infected traveller per week, we find that in 75% of simulations the outbreak is delayed by at least 11 days (97.5% probability: at least 7 days). The possible delay decreases rapidly for more travellers, lower effectiveness of sensitisation, higher R0 or lower heterogeneity thereof. However, syndromic traveller screening at departure and/or arrival can further enhance impact. In combination with sensitisation, syndromic screening can delay an outbreak substantially longer. In 75% of simulations we find an outbreak delay of at least 120 days (97.5% simulations: at least 24 days) for 1 infected traveller per week and at least 9 days (97.5% probability: at least 4 days) for 10 infected travellers per week.
