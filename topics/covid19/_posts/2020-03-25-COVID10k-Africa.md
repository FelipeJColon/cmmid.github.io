# Summary

[Projection of early spread of COVID-19 in Africa as of 25 March 2020](reports/COVID10k_Africa.pdf)

We prepared a report for several African stakeholders estimating the time countries would reach 1000 and 10000 reported cases.
Based on current trends, we find almost all African countries are likely to pass 1000 reported cases by 1 May, and 10000 within
another few weeks; alarmingly, these are largely synchronised continent-wide, and real burdens are certainly higher than
reports. This calls for urgent action across Africa.

*Note: this version includes a typo correction: replacing 0.38 with 0.58 dispersion for new cases.*
